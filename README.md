# ShapeFall
A Unity mobile game that tests player's ability to act fast and think ahead. It's a simple concept. Match the box's shape with the shape that's about to fall into it. What's the highest score you can get?

# Purpose
This app was developed to learn the design and build process of making 2D games in Unity. I learned about integrating the C# code into different objects of a game, making different scripts communicate with one another, and publishing the final product to the Google Play Store.
